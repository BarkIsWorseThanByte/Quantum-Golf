# Quantum-Golf

game idea:
- golf with an electron
    - tunnel through obstacles
    - keep your particle from disappearing due to becoming "too uncertain" to plot by making it to electron traps
    - use protons and other point charges to help guide your electron to its destination

game play:
- direct the particle with `left-arrow`, `right-arrow` or `a`, `d`
- modify launch velocity with `w`, `d`
- modify velocity certainty with `up-arrow`, `down-arrow`
    - the more certain your velocity, the faster your particle becomes "too uncertain"
- launch with `space`

implements:
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle, effects on velocity and position
- Tunneling, through probabilistic collisions
- Coulomb forces
